====================

A simple set of scripts to try and allow a Raspberry Pi Zero to be used headlessly.

Creates the usb rdns gadget to allow for connection on 172.16.0.1 (dhcp's host computer 172.16.0.2)
Allows the usb to be connected and shared from the host computer - receives dhcp from host.
Has a semi-useful usb mass-storage gadget. (Seen some sync issues when mounting image on pi zero)
