# USB setup

# Make sure to change USB_PID if you enable different USB functionality in order
# to force Windows to enumerate the device again
USB_VID="0x2e8a"        # Vendor ID
USB_PID="0x0137"        # Product ID

USE_ECM=true            # if true CDC ECM will be enabled
USE_RNDIS=true          # if true RNDIS will be enabled
USE_UMS=                # if true USB Mass Storage will be enabled

# Network and DHCP options USB over Ethernet

# We choose an IP with a very small subnet (see comments in README.rst)

WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_HIDE_SSID=false # use to hide SSID of WLAN (you have to manually connect to the name given by WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_NAME)

WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_DHCP_BE_GATEWAY=false # propagate usbgadget as router if true (only makes sense when an upstream is available
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_DHCP_BE_DNS=false # propagate usbgadget as nameserver if true (only makes sense when an upstream is available
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_DNS_FORWARD=false # if true, usbgadget listens with a DNS forwader on UPD port 53 of the WiFi interface (traffic is forwaded to usbgadget's system DNS)


# WiFi Client Settings
# --------------------

WIFI_CLIENT=false 	# enables connecting to existing WiFi (currently only WPA2 PSK)
			# example payload: wifi_connect.txt
			# Warning: could slow down boot, because:
			#	- scan for target network is issued upfront
			#	- DHCP client is started and waits for a lease on WiFi adapter
			# Note: if WIFI_ACCESSPOINT is enabled, too:
			#	- P4wnP1 tries to connect to the given WiFi
			# 	- if connection fails, the AccessPoint is started instead
WIFI_CLIENT_SSID="Accespoint Name" # name of target network
WIFI_CLIENT_PSK="AccessPoint password" # passphrase for target network
WIFI_CLIENT_STORE_NETWORK=false # unused right now, should be used to store known networks, but priority has to be given if multiple known networks are present
WIFI_CLIENT_OVERWRITE_PSK=true # unused right now, in case the network WIFI_CLIENT_STORE_NETWORK is set an existing PSK gets overwritten
